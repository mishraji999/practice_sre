for basic Github CI:
You push code
↓
GitHub creates a Linux VM
↓
Repo is cloned into it
↓
Docker is installed
↓
docker build -t todo-app . is run
↓
Success or failure reported
↓
VM deleted


for basic Kubernetes understanding:
Kubernetes is a system that runs your Docker images, keeps them alive, and gives users a stable way to access them.

Minikube VM → Service → Pod → Container → FastAPI

Minikube VM: fake server

Service: door into the app

Pod: wrapper Kubernetes controls

Container: Docker image running

FastAPI: your code


when we did this ->
'''''
kubectl expose deployment todo-app --type=NodePort --port=8000
You told Kubernetes:

“Create a stable door in front of my app so outside traffic can reach it.”
